# Your startup name here

[My Notes](notes.md)

THe application I will be creating is a live feed up cyrpto coins on the solana block chain. Users can filter and see live prices of multiple coins at once, and discover live PNLs of different users on different coins. This will incorporate live charts, live filters, and live tables of transactions occurring.

> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Key features

- Live Price Updates: Provides instant access to the latest prices, ensuring users stay informed in the volatile meme coin market, continuously fetches and displays real-time price data for all tracked Solana meme coins, and helps trades make smart choices when choosing to buy or sell
- Interactive Live Charts: Offers a visual representation of price trends, trading volumes, and historical performance, and allows users to predict current coin trends
- Live Transaction Table: Displays live feeds of transactions, including details like token amounts, wallet addresses, and timestamps.

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use to structure the website's content, such as headings, tables for transaction data, sections for charts, and navigation menus
- **CSS** - I will use to enhance and style the website to make it visually appealing for users and to ensure a clean and smooth visual expereince
- **React** - I will use React to manage the dynamic front-end, enabling real-time updates of prices, charts, and transaction tables. The React components will handle user interactions, state management, and rendering live data efficiently.
- **Service** - I will use API integration with services like Solana blockchain explorers or third-party providers for fetching price data, chart data, and transaction histories. Services will handle requests and responses for live updates
- **DB/Login** - I will use this to store user-specific data such as watchlists, preferences, and account information. Login functionality ensures secure access to personalized features like alerts and saved settings.
- **WebSocket** - I will use WebSocket to facilitate live data streaming for prices, charts, and transaction tables by maintaining real-time connections to the blockchain or data providers, ensuring instant updates without frequent API polling.
